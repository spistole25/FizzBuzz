# FizzBuzz

remember: 
npm init
    this creates the .json file for you from the command line

We're gonna try to determine if the numbers are divisible by 3, 5, or 15

Creating our own module
    create index.js
    now we're turning it into a module by adding the following to the fizzbuzz.js
        module.export = fizz_buzz;

added "jest to tests in package.json

npm install jest in the terminal

then npm run test
